# Condo (software manager)

## Description

This project involves managing building expenses, collecting payments from each unit owner, and ensuring transparency and compliance with legal requirements. Here’s a structured guide for what I want:

1. Understand the Market and Existing Solutions
There are already several established tools in Portugal for condominium management, such as:

- O Teu Condomínio: Offers quota management, budgeting, resident access, repair requests, and works across devices.
- Flexdomus: Cloud-based, allows for quick setup, communication with residents, expense tracking, and is priced per fraction.
- Gecond: Market leader, supports large and small administrators, offers bank integration, maintenance management, and legal compliance.
- GO Condomínios: Focuses on ease of use and immediate access.
Key features these platforms provide:
- Expense and budget management
- Quota calculation and payment tracking
- Communication tools (email/SMS to residents)
- Document management (meeting minutes, budgets, regulations)
- Maintenance and repair requests
- Transparency and access for all co-owners

2. Legal and Practical Requirements
Portuguese law is quite specific about condominium management:

- Transparency: Financial reports and accounts must be accessible to all owners.
- Reserve Fund: Legally required, at least 10% of monthly dues.
- Debt Management: Administrators must track and collect overdue payments, including penalties.
- Meetings: Annual and sometimes more frequent meetings, with proper minutes and digital communication now allowed.
- Tax Compliance: Administrators must declare condominium income and issue electronic receipts.
- Updated Owner Data: Administrators must keep owner information current and manage changes in ownership.

3. Opportunities for Differentiation
Despite existing solutions, there are still pain points and niches you can target:

- User Experience: Many platforms are “functional but clunky.” A modern, intuitive interface could appeal to younger administrators or self-managed buildings.
- Self-Managed Condos: Many tools target professional administrators. A lightweight, affordable solution for small buildings managed by residents themselves could fill a gap.
- Mobile-first Experience: Seamless mobile management for on-the-go communication, payments, and notifications.
- Automated Legal Compliance: Built-in reminders and templates for required legal documents, meeting minutes, and tax filings.
- Open API/Integrations: Allowing integration with banks, payment platforms (MB Way, Multibanco), or messaging apps.
- Conflict Resolution Tools: Features for anonymous voting, issue tracking, or mediation support.
- Multilingual Support: Useful for buildings with international residents.
- AI-powered Insights: Predictive maintenance, expense forecasting, or automated document summarization.
